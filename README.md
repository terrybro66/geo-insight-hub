## 1. Project Setup and Planning

Initialize the project: Use npm init to create a package.json file for your project.
Set up the backend: Create a new directory for your backend (e.g., backend) and initialize it with npm init.
Set up the frontend: Similarly, create a new directory for your frontend (e.g., frontend) and initialize it with create-react-app.
Plan your application: Sketch out the architecture of your application, including the data flow, the components you'll need, and the APIs you'll expose.

## 2. Backend Development

### 2.1. Setting Up Express

Install Express: Run npm install express in your backend directory.
Create a basic server: Write a simple Express server to ensure everything is set up correctly.

### 2.2. Data Processing

Install D3.js: Run npm install d3 in your backend directory.
Write tests: Before writing the actual data processing logic, write tests for the expected behavior. Use a testing framework like Jest.
Implement data processing: Use D3.js to parse CSV, JSON, and XLS files. Write tests as you go to ensure each part of your data processing logic works as expected.

### 2.3. Web Scraping

Choose a scraping library: For scraping data from websites, consider using Puppeteer or Cheerio.
Write tests: Write tests for your scraping logic to ensure it correctly extracts the data you need.
Implement scraping: Implement the scraping logic, ensuring to follow the website's terms of service and to handle any potential errors gracefully.

## 3. Frontend Development

### 3.1. Setting Up React

Create a new React app: Use create-react-app to set up your frontend project.
Install necessary libraries: Install Deck.gl and Mapbox GL JS for rendering maps and layers.

### 3.2. Developing Components

Write tests: Use a testing library like React Testing Library to write tests for your React components.
Implement components: Develop components for displaying maps and layers based on the data processed by your backend.

## 4. Integration and Testing

Integrate frontend and backend: Ensure your frontend can communicate with your backend through APIs.
Write integration tests: Write tests that simulate user interactions and verify that the frontend and backend work together as expected.

## 5. Deployment

Choose a hosting platform: Decide where to host your application. Consider cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
Prepare for deployment: Ensure your application is ready for deployment, including setting up environment variables and configuring your database if you're using one.

## 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up CI/CD: Use a service like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment.
Write CI/CD scripts: Write scripts that run your tests and deploy your application whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitor your application: Use monitoring tools to keep track of your application's performance and to catch any errors or issues early.
Plan for maintenance: Regularly update your dependencies, review your code for security vulnerabilities, and plan for any necessary maintenance or updates.
This plan provides a high-level overview of the development process. Each step involves detailed work that requires careful planning and execution. Remember, the key to TDD is writing tests before you write the actual code, ensuring that your application is robust and behaves as expected.
